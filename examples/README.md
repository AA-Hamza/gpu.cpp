# Examples (Work-in-Progress)

Here are some standalone projects exemplifying how to use this library as well
as what's under the hood. NOTE: These examples are a work-in-progress.


In order of expertise (beginner to advanced):

- hello_world - Minimal template project to get started with the gpu.cpp library.
- gpu_puzzles - (WIP) Implementation of Sasha Rush's GPU puzzles https://github.com/srush/GPU-Puzzles
- render - GPU rendering of a signed distance function.
- physics - (TODO) physics demo (either flows or N replicated double pendulums)
- transformer - (TODO) a neural network transformer block computation
- autograd - (TODO) toy autograd
- webgpu_intro - A minimal from-scratch example of how to use WebGPU directly
  without this library. This is useful to understand the code internals of
  gpu.cpp.
