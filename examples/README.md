# Examples (Work-in-Progress)

NOTE: These examples are a work-in-progress - do not use them yet.

Here are some standalone projects exemplifying how to use this library as well
as what's under the hood.

In order of expertise (beginner to advanced):

- hello_gpu - Setting up the GPU context and running a simple GELU kernel.
- raymarch - Using the webgpu computation to implement a toy raymarcher as an
   example of non-ML general purpose computation. 
- webgpu_intro - A minimal from-scratch example of how to use WebGPU directly
  without this library. This is useful to understand the code internals of
  gpu.cpp.
